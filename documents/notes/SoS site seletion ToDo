#SoS site seletion to do

1 work out what Daisy's code is trying to do
2 research representativeness & get thoughts into a document
3 get an agenda sorted for Monday's meeting
4 think about what to say to James BB
5 think about the AOO revision
6 think about the summary page
- Daisy has already had a think about this
- What I'd like to do is present a ranking of populations to add, so SoS can choose what sites to add given the optimal number calculated by Iadine/Sam's group

7 get in touch with Iadine/Sam re: numbers of sites to add



How many clusters are already represented within SoS sites?

Is there a way to show what is the biggest differentiator between clusters? 
- or, which variable is responsible for adjacent populations belonging to different clusters?

Is there a way to quantify the distinctivness between clusters?
- e.g. cluster b is more different from cluster a than cluster c is from cluster b...

There might not even be any reason to force a user to manually select sites?
- could just output the results of the cluster analysis in a table...
- SoS could then select which specific populations or AOO pixels they'd want to protect
- this might be based on other factors, such as whether the population is already in a reserve, what the population size is, proximity to other operations etc.


## FUTURE CLIMATES ##

Useful to get actual projections, rather than just change

	Daisy has BOM data which is 1960-1990. We need a mean of 1990-2009, so that we can combine it with the 2009-2069 projected change.
	Or could see if jbaums has given me code already to get multimodel mean projections


## CURRENT CLIMATES ##

Get ANUClim data

Include tavg

Rainfall variability:

http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/climatology/gridded-data-info/metadata/md_ave_rain_var.shtml
based on monthly data
Rainfall variability = (90th percentile â€“ 10th percentile) / 50th percentile.
